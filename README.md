# NLP_modes
The goal of this project is to explore and develop a text summarization system that can digest a large body of text and generate a concise and meaningful summary. This task involves various aspects of NLP, such as text preprocessing, word embeddings, and sequence-to-sequence modeling.
The project consists of the following parts:
1. Data Preprocessing:
● Load the provided dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
● Preprocess the text data: remove stop words, perform tokenization, stem or lemmatize the words
etc.
● Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
2. Model Building:
● Develop a sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization. Explore architectures like LSTM
(Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), or even transformer-based models
like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative
Pre-trained Transformer), etc.
● Train the model on the training set and tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.
3. Evaluation:
● Test the model on the testing set.
